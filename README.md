<h2>Fundamental Concepts</h2>
<br>
<ol>
    <li><h3>Node</h3>
        <p>A Node is a standalone entity of the ROS2 framework that performs a specific task, process data, and communicate with other nodes to achieve a specific functionality from a robotic system.</p></li>
    <li><h3>Topic</h3>
        <p>A Topic is a communication channel that enables data transfer between nodes. It implements the publisher-subscriber model. It is a one communication channel in which a node can publish on a topic or multiple topics and a topic can have multiple subscribers.</p></li>
    <li><h3>Service</h3>
        <p>A Service is another means of communication in ROS2. It implements the server-client protocol. It is a two way communication channel in which a client node makes a request to the server node and server node processes the request and sends back a response.</p></li>
